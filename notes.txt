interface ipost

wp posts inherit from ipost


is it OK to inject post repository into blog controller in addition to blog repository?

in update, will unit of work commit work for posts also if they are removed?

in update method, catch DbUpdateConcurrencyException requires using System.Data.Entity.Infrastructure;
